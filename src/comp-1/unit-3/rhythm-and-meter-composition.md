# Composition: Rhythm and Meter

## Overview

Write a piece of music for three to five instruments or voices that deals with the concept of rhythm and meter. The instrumentation may include body percussion, found percussion, or similar sounds and techniques. The piece should be 1-3 minutes long[^length] and should *reflect something new about rhythm and meter you have learned, that we have discussed in class, or discovered in assigned listening.* All compositions will be read in our class reading sessions, so please consider the available performers in our class and technical limitations of sight-readers.

## Assignment deliverables and readings

Each of these is required. Submit all digital files via Webcourses. Bring paper copies to class for reading sessions.

* **PDF**:
    * full score, either hand-written or computer-engraved
* **PDF**:
    * Reflection: A brief written description of the way you addressed rhythm and meter in this composition (100-200 words).
* **Paper submission**:
    * hard copy of the score and parts for reading. *Performance materials should be clean, clear, and professional. If you aren't sure what your score or parts should look like, compare them to scores and parts from a major publisher.*

## Grading

Please review the Composition Project Rubric in the Pages tab of Webcourses.

[^length]: Pieces with slower tempos and rhythms should be at the longer end of this range. Pieces with faster tempos and rhythms may be closer to one minute.

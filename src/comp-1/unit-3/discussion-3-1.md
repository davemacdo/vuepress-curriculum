Title: Discussion - Steve Reich

Listen to two very different recordings of music by Steve Reich: _Clapping Music_ (1972) and the first movement of _Tehillim_ (1981).

Write a post on this discussion board in response to the music. Your post should be 300-500 words long. Your post should address the following:

- These works are very long for the amount of musical material they express. Do they maintain interest for their whole duration? If so, how? If not, why not?
- How do these two works use meter in different ways?
- How do meter and rhythm in these works affect your sense of phrases and larger divisions?

Once you've made your post, consider responding to a classmates post. Do so substantively in a way that contributes to the conversation. Just saying "Nice post!" is friendly but doesn't do much to enrich the discussion. Come to class prepared to discuss the contents of the listening and your post.

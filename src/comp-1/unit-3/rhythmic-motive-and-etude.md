Title: Rhythmic Motive and Étude

## Motive

Create a single rhythmic motive. Your motive should be long enough to be distinctive, but concise enough to be memorable. 

## Étude

Write a short étude for clapping or other body percussion that develops your motive in a clearly perceptible way. Your étude will be for one to four parts and should be able to be read by the other composers in the class.

## Deliverable

- **PDF**:
	- Your motive, labeled on its own line.
	- Your étude. 

Come to class prepared to share, perform, and discuss your motive and étude. Think about what makes it distinctive and how you could continue to transform it perceptibly.

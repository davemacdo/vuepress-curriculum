* begin building a portfolio of original compositions

#### Course Prerequisites

Students must carry at least a B average through these two core theory courses.

During the periods marked "lessons", we will not meet as a full class. Instead, students will schedule individual 30-minute lessons with the instructor. Project readings will be rough sight-reading sessions of student compositions. Students _must_ be in attendance to _listen to_ and _perform_ one another's works.

#### Required Course Materials

##### Text

* individual reading and listening assignments, posted or linked in Webcourses

##### Other materials

* **Notebook of blank staff paper and pencil**: Do not use staff paper that includes pre-printed clefs, barlines, instrument names, tablature lines, etc. Do not use a pen.
* **USB flash drive**: We will sometimes be working on the computers in the classroom. You will need to save your work to your own storage.

##### Supplementary materials

The following are not required, but may prove useful:

* **An orchestration text**: We will not be dealing directly with orchestration in the class, but a basic understanding of instruments and voice types will prove useful. If you intend to study orchestration at UCF, the current textbook is Samuel Adler's _The Study of Orchestration_, but smaller references would also be acceptable for our purposes.
* **Elaine Gould: _Behind Bars_**: This is an incredible resource on the best practices of music notation. You'd be surprised at how often our notation software gets things wrong! Gould's book will serve you for as long as you are preparing scores as a composer, arranger, or teacher. 
* New music listening and information sources:
    * [_NewMusicBox_](http://newmusicbox.org): Features interviews, essays, and news about new music.
    * [_Meet the Composer_](http://www.wqxr.org/#!/programs/meet-composer/): Podcast featuring interviews with living composers about their music. There are some great playlists here as well.

#### Grading

In general, subjective assessments will be made by the instructor regarding preparation, performance competency, class participation, and attendance. The semester grade will be weighted by points.

| Grades ||
| :---: | --- |
| 15 | attendance and participation |
| 5 each | études, exercises, discussions, and lessons |
| 15 | listening exam |
| 10 each | concerts |
| 50 | Composition 1 |
| 50 | Composition 2 |
| 50 | Composition 3 |


* **Attendance and participation**: Attendance and class participation is expected, and will be taken by sign-in sheet. The attendance grade will be proportional to the number of class meetings and reading sessions the student attends, allowing **_two_** unexcused absences only. Students will not be excused from lessons. Because members of the class will rely on one another, reading sessions will only be excused for university sanctioned travel or documented medical or family emergency, and only if the instructor is notified as soon as possible of the conflict.
* **Études, exercises, discussions, and lessons**: Small composition assignments, written/in-class discussions, and other exercises will be assigned at various points in the term. Each student will meet for an individual lesson with the instructor one to two times in preparation for each composition assignment. Some particularly large assignments may be double the usual weight. These will be clearly indicated in the assignment specification or rubric.
* **Listening Exam**: Various listening activities will be assigned throughout the semester. Some will have discussion boards attached, others will be presented in class. All of these may be included on a listening identification exam at the end of the semester.
* **Concerts**: Students must attend at least two concerts featuring new music and write a brief summary of their experience.

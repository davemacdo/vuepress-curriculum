# Final Listening Review Guide

To assess your listening habits over the semester, the final listening quiz will cover listening assignments from the whole semester. To simplify your studying, I've combined all the unit-specific lists into one big list here. You'll take the quiz during our final exam period. 

On the quiz, I'll play a characteristic excerpt of each piece, and you'll write the composer and title of the work. (You'll need to know this information yourself. There won't be an option bank.) The excerpts will be about 30 to 60 seconds long. I'll play through all of them in order twice with a break in between.

I've compiled this Spotify playlist that includes everything except the Dargel, which you can find on his site.

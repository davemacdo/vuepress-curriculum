# Composition I-II: Project Rubric

You will see that some parts of this rubric are quite rigid while others are more subjective. It is important that you are able to express your musical ideas freely while also staying in the context of our class assignments. If you feel that your work has been evaluated unfairly, please discuss it with the professor.

## Preparation and Professionalism

<!-- ### Lesson preparation: *25 points*

* **20-25 points:** The composer showed up to the lesson on time. The composer had made significant progress in the composition and presented a logical plan to express clear musical ideas and complete the work by the deadline.
* **10-19 points:** The composer showed up on time. However, the composer had made only minimal progress on the work or did not have a clear idea of his or her compositional goals. The plan or the work-in-progress was poorly organized or not clearly documented.
* **0-9 points:** The composer was late or did not show up to the lesson. The composer had not started working on the composition or only had vague verbal descriptions of the work.  -->

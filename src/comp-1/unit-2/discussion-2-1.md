# Discussion: Motive

Read the excerpt on motives from Arnold Schoenberg's _Fundamentals of Musical Composition_. Pay close attention to his musical examples as well.

Write a post on this discussion board in response to the excerpt. Your post should be 300-500 words long. Your post should address the following:

- In your own words, explain what a motive is. Be sure to address how a motive is different from a theme.
- Explain how we as listeners can identify a motive.
- Schoenberg explains several ways that motives can be transformed. Can you think of anything he forgot?

Composers constantly rework and transform their motives. Beethoven's Symphony No. 5 is probably the most widely known example. Feel free to share any of your favorite examples from other composers. Be sure to maintain the distinction between _theme_ and _motive_! 

Once you've made your post, consider responding to a classmates post. Do so substantively in a way that contributes to the conversation. Just saying "Nice post!" is friendly but doesn't do much to enrich the discussion. Come to class prepared to discuss the contents of the reading and your post. Keep the concept of motives and variation in mind as you listen to music for this class.

# Project Spec

- Focus on only one or two motives.
- Single-line instrument only
- Musical guidelines
	- No meter or barlines
	- No scales or triads
	- Reasoning:
		- focus on motives, not other things
		- encourage you to stretch and try new things
		- I don't want you to start with a key and meter and fill in the measures. I want you to start with sonic ideas and use the meters and pitches (possibly keys) that express those ideas most efficiently.
- Lesson sign-ups on on Webcourses

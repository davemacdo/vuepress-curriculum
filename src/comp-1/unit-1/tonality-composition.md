# Composition: Tonality

## Overview

Write a piece of music for two to three instruments or voices that deals with the concept of tonality and scales. The piece should be 1-3 minutes long[^length] and should *include at least two distinct tonal areas, key centers, or scales.* All compositions will be read in our class reading sessions, so please consider the available performers in our class and technical limitations of sight-readers. You may write your scores and parts by hand or on the computer. 

## Assignment deliverables and readings

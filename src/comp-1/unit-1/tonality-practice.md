In this assignment, you will practice writing the same melodic ideas using different scales. Note what makes each scale distinctive and focus on those things.

## Part 1: Scales

Select a set of three scales from the handout in class or from others you know. (These may be transposed to other tonal centers from the way they are written in class.) Write the scales out in the transpositions in which you will use them. Create your own fourth scale. Do not use key signatures. Label each scale. You may wish to refer to the excerpt from Vincent Persichetti's _Twentieth-Century Harmony_ posted on Webcourses.

## Part 2: Melody

Create a one- or two-phrase melody of at least seven measures. Express the melody four times, each using one of the four scales you have identified in Part 1. Allow the melody to adapt to each of the scales, expressing what is unique about the scale **while retaining its basic contour, rhythm, and phrasing**. The melody does not need to use every pitch in each scale, but it should adequately express the scale.

## Stay tuned ...

Our next assignment will be to take these melodic ideas and string them together into a simple Ã©tude for solo-line instrument, unaccompanied. 

## Deliverables

- **PDF:**
    - Your four scales, written out on a staff. (Three existing, one of your own creation.)
    - Four variations of your melody, one for each scale.

Be prepared to present your melodies in class either at the piano or on your own instrument.

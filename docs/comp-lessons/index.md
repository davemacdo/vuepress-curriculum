title: Composition Lessons
---

Over several semesters (Composition 3-4 for undergraduate students, Composition 5-6 for graduate students), composers will create a variety of musical compositions according to their own interest and the guidance of the professor. Students will present performances of some of these works. They will also develop a greater understanding of musical repertoire of the 20th and 21st centuries through guided listening, score study, masterclasses, and concert attendance.

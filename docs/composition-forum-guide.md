# Composition Forum Guide

## Overview

The semesterly Composition Forum Recital is a fantastic opportunity for several reasons.

* Hear your music performed by real people, and not the robots that live in your computer.
* Work directly with performers to make your scores and parts clearer and your music more playable.
* Share the results of your hard work and creativity with the department.
* Get an excellent grade in lessons by meeting the performance requirement. (This can be fulfilled with other concerts or recitals as well.)
* Add to your portfolio of recordings.
* Have fun.

All UCF composition majors are eligible to present works on the Composition Forum concerts. Other music majors working on composition may be included if time permits.

## Program Submission

**Four weeks before** the date of the Composition Forum, please submit the following information to Dr. MacDonald. A link to a submission form will be sent via email.

* Your name
* Title of your work
* Instrumentation
* Approximate duration
* Performers' names
* Program note

**Two weeks before** the date of the Composition Forum, please submit a rehearsal recording[^recording] of your piece to Dr. MacDonald. It doesn't have to be fancy. A recording from your phone is fine. *Failure to submit this recording will result in your piece being pulled from the program.*

## Working With Performers

* **Start early.** Get commitments from your performers as early as possible. The best situation is to start working with performers from the minute you start composing the piece. Start rehearsals as early as possible. Get scores and parts to your performers five to six weeks before the concert, and start rehearsals about four weeks before the concert.
* **Be professional.** Give your performers as much respect as you would give any professional, even though they may be your friends. Give them the sharpest, most polished performance materials possible. Attend rehearsals whenever possible. Give specific, useful feedback.
* **Don't grovel.** When approaching performers, don't just ask them to play your music; ask them to collaborate with you. There is a difference between "Will you please practice this eight-minute piece, attend four rehearsals, and give a performance?" and "I would really like to collaborate with you. Would you like to work with me on this piece?" Help them feel ownership over the project and privileged to be a part of bringing to life a *brand new piece of music that nobody has ever heard before!*
* **Say "thank you."** It may be obvious, but just saying thank you means a lot. You aren't expected to pay your performers, but saying thank you and maybe buying them a coffee wouldn't go amiss.

[^recording]: "Rehearsal recording" doesn't mean that it needs to be ready to perform, but it should demonstrate that you are well on your way to a good performance at the Forum. This should *not* be a sight-read. Players on this recording should be the same as will appear on the Forum.

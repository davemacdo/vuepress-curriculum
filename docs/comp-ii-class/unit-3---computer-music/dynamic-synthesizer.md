Title: Dynamic synthesizer

Create a Pd patch that makes a continuous sound that incorporates multiple synthesis objects (such as `osc~`). The sound should last a minimum of ten seconds, but may run indefinitely.  Try to make the sound change over time, such as a drone that shifts in timbre or pitch. You may use any objects we have studied in class or that you discover on your own. 

_Compress your project into a ZIP archive before uploading._

## Deliverables

Submit all files on Webcourses.

- **ZIP archive** including your patch. If it's not obvious, please indicate using a comment (Put > Comment) where to click to start and/or stop the sound.

Be prepared to present your work in class for feedback and critique. 

## Grading

This assignment will be graded on a pass-fail basis. To pass, the patch must run and meet the minimum requirements described in the instructions.

Title: Composition: Free composition

## Overview

Write a piece of music for up to five instruments or voices. That's it.

You are free to chose any subject or theme to focus on for this project. In some ways, this is the culmination of all the other topics we've discussed in Composition I and II. The piece should be coherent, cohesive, creative, and experimental, just like everything else you have composed this year. The instrumentation may anything that can be read during our class reading sessions. The piece should be 2-5 minutes long[^length].

All compositions will be read in our class reading sessions, so please consider the available performers in our class and technical limitations of sight-readers.

## Assignment deliverables and readings

Each of these is required. Submit all digital files via Webcourses. Bring paper copies to class for reading sessions.

* **PDF**:
    * full score, either hand-written or computer-engraved, this includes graphic scores or instruction-based scores
* **PDF**:
    * Reflection: A brief written description of the way you addressed extended techniques and unconventional notation in this composition (100-200 words).
* **Paper submission**:
    * hard copy of the score and parts for reading. *Performance materials should be clean, clear, and professional. If you aren't sure what your score or parts should look like, compare them to scores and parts from a major publisher.*

## Grading

Please review the Composition Project Rubric in the Pages tab of Webcourses.

[^length]: Pieces with slower tempos and rhythms should be at the longer end of this range. Pieces with faster tempos and rhythms may be closer to one minute.

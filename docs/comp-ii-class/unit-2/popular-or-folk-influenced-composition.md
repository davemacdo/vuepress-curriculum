# Composition: Popular or Folk Influence

## Overview

Write a piece of music for two to five instruments or voices that incorporates influences from popular, folk, or other non-Western-classical music tradition. As we will discover, the challenge is in writing a piece that incorporates influences from another music without co√∂pting something from a culture we don't belong to, [exoticizing another group](https://dialmformusicology.com/2014/08/01/exoticism-and-racism-and-the-whole-damn-thing/), or creating a flimsy imitation of a pop or folk tune. The instrumentation may anything that can be read during our class reading sessions. The piece should be 1-3 minutes long[^length] and should *reflect something new about the topics we have discussed in class, or discovered in assigned listening.* All compositions will be read in our class reading sessions, so please consider the available performers in our class and technical limitations of sight-readers.

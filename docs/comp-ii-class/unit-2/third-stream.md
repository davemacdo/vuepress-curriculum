Title: Third Stream étude

Schuller's Third Stream was a new music that was between the mainstream of classical music and the mainstream of jazz. It wasn't mean to coöpt one on behalf of the other; nor was it meant to replace either. Take your planning from the previous assignment and put it to work in a short étude that combines elements of your non-classical model recording with elements of the contemporary classical tradition. 

## Write

Write a _short_ étude for piano, either alone or with a solo instrument, that expresses the musical elements that you identified previously. Your étude should be between 12 and 20 measures long and notated as completely as a finished piece with dynamics, articulations, etc. 

## Deliverables (2 files)

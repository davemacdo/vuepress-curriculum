# UCF Composition Senior Recital Guide

## Program requirements

All recital programs are subject to the approval of your primary composition professor.

- Senior recital programs should include a minimum of 30 minutes of music, not including any set changes or time between pieces. The program should demonstrate a well-rounded portfolio including the following:
	- at least one piece longer than seven minutes
	- a variety of mediums, by ensemble size and instrument family
- The program should consist of pieces that you worked on with your professor. If you would like to program anything from outside lessons, you will need your professor's approval first.
- The program should favor more recent works. Ideally, it will include pieces written exclusively during your time in Comp III and IV.
- With advance approval from your professor, performances by large ensembles at UCF (orchestra, choirs, or concert bands) that occur during the same academic year as the recital may be counted toward the 30-minute program minimum. Reading sessions are not sufficient to meeting this requirement.

## Scheduling

- Submit five recital options, in order of preference, on or before the Friday of the first week of classes of the semester you'll be presenting your recital.
- Evening recitals in the Rehearsal Hall are _not possible_ on Monday and Wednesday, due to orchestra rehearsal.
- Check the department calendar online to be sure your five options are available. Allow for a 30-minute setup period before the recital.
- **All spring-semester composition recitals must be presented _before_ UCF Celebrates the Arts, preferably by the end of March!** This will hopefully prevent us from having to compete for rooms, equipment, and most importantly, performers' time.

## Hearing and program approval

- By the end if week 2 of the semester, secure the participation of a three-member recital hearing committee. The committee must include Dr. MacDonald and two other full-time faculty members in the music department.
- Submit a complete draft of the recital program, including a program note for each piece on the program, a minimum of four weeks before the recital (two weeks before the hearing). This should be emailed to Dr. MacDonald and all other members of your committee.
	- Faculty with give feedback and suggest revisions on program notes.
	- Verify any technical or logistical needs at this point, such as audio playback, video projector, multi-piano works, or large percussion setups.
- You are responsible for scheduling your hearing at a time that suits the members of the committee and the performers at least two weeks before the recital date.
	- Live performances on the hearing are preferred. However, works for five players or more can be recorded if scheduling does not allow all performers to attend the hearing. These recordings must be complete, unedited, and include the same personnel that will perform on the recital. Other recorded hearings of individual works may be considered on a case-by-case basis.
	- Submit digital (PDF) copies of all scores, along with revised program and notes, to all members of the committee before the hearing.
	- Bring a bound copy of each score, as well as a printed copy of the program and notes.

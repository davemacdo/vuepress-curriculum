During the week or two prior to class reading sessions, students will meet one-on-one with the instructor for a lesson. Bring the following to your lesson:

- handwritten, printed copy, or PDF (emailed to instructor) of any work you have done to this point
- a plan for how the composition will unfold (written, drawn, or in your head)
- staff paper and pencil to take notes
- optional: If you work on a laptop, you may bring your computer in and show your composition in your chosen scoring program. If you don't want to bring your computer, you may email the PDF and audio file to the instructor before the lesson.

### Rubric: *5 points*

- **5 points:** The composer showed up to the lesson on time. The composer had made significant progress in the composition and presented a logical plan to express clear musical ideas and complete the work by the deadline.
- **4 points:** The composer showed up on time. However, the composer had made only minimal progress on the work or did not have a clear idea of his or her compositional goals. The plan or the work-in-progress was poorly organized or not clearly documented.
- **2 points:** The composer showed up on time. There was very little progress on the work. The composer had only vague ideas about how the work would unfold or had difficulty explaining their ideas.
- **0 points:** The composer was late or did not show up to the lesson. The composer had not started working on the composition or only had vague verbal descriptions of the work.

The best situation is to start working with performers from the minute you start composing the piece. Start rehearsals as early as possible. Get scores and parts to your performers five to six weeks before the concert, and start rehearsals about four weeks before the concert.</li><li><strong>Be professional.</strong> Give your performers as much respect as you would give any professional, even though they may be your friends. Give them the sharpest, most polished performance materials possible. Attend rehearsals whenever possible. Give specific, useful feedback.</li><li><strong>Don’t grovel.</strong> When approaching performers, don’t just ask them to play your music; ask them to collaborate with you. There is a difference between “Will you please practice this eight-minute piece, attend four rehearsals, and give a performance?” and “I would really like to collaborate with you. Would you like to work with me on this piece?” Help them feel ownership over the project and privileged to be a part of bringing to life a <em>brand new piece of music that nobody has ever heard before!</em></li><li><strong>Say “thank you.”</strong> It may be obvious, but just saying thank you means a lot. You aren’t expected to pay your performers, but saying thank you and maybe buying them a coffee wouldn’t go amiss.</li></ul><hr class="footnotes-sep"><section class="footnotes"><ol class="footnotes-list"><li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p>“Rehearsal recording” doesn’t mean that it needs to be ready to perform, but it should demonstrate that you are well on your way to a good performance at the Forum.

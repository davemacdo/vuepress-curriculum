Thanks to Sibelius, Finale, and other scoring applications, this is easier than ever before. Despite this, I strongly encourage young composers to begin all of their composition projects on paper for several important reasons.</p><p>First, your computer has been designed by some extremely clever social scientists to have a maximum number of distractions. It's much harder to focus on cognitively difficult tasks like composition when Reddit is just a few clicks away. It's not that you're a bad person or lack will power. You're just one person against an army of psychology PhDs.</p><p>Second---and more important---any software you use in the computer was designed by people to make music that already exists. Sibelius and Finale are great at creating scores quickly and easily if those scores conform to certain expectations. Part of being an artist is to contradict expectations sometimes. I start all of my projects on paper because I don't want to give myself the opportunity to make a creative decision based on what is easiest to do in the computer, even subconsciously.</p><p>Having said all that, one of the only things I love more than working on a new piece of music on a nice big sheet of manuscript paper, is <em>not</em> having to deal with paper at all when I don't want to. When am working by myself, the paper is great. I usually do a good job of keeping track of it. Usually. But, I can still lose it or spill coffee all over it, and even then I have to carry the stuff around everywhere I want to work. That's why it's important to have a plan to move from paper to PDF at some point.</p><p><strong>Paper to PDF:</strong> At some point---like say, submitting your beautifully handwritten manuscript to your well-meaning-if-somewhat-eccentric composition professor---you will need to scan your paper to convert it. This used to be expensive, tedious, and usually both. Today though, the camera in your smartphone is pretty dang good, and there are some clever apps available to scan your work right on your phone. Here are a few options.</p><ul><li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scanner-pro-pdf-document-scanner-with-ocr/id333710667?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scanner Pro<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> is what I use; but it's iOS-only and costs $3.99.</li><li>Office Lens (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/office-lens/id975925059?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.office.officelens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>) is from Microsoft and part of the Office suite.

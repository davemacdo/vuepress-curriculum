We’re obviously listening to a fair number of recordings in the class, but we should also listen to live performances when we can.</p><p>Each student must attend at minimum of two performances of new music from the list provided. Please start this early. Sometimes performances are moved or canceled at the last minute!</p><p>For each of these, you must attend the entire performance to the bitter end! Write 300-500 words on the music you heard. Focus on <em>objective statements</em> about the works on the program. Consider addressing the following (not all will apply to every piece):</p><ul><li>What about the piece do you find interesting?</li><li>How does the composer make use of the instruments or voice types used?</li><li>What textures does the composer use?</li><li>(How) does the composer create a sense of progression (moving from one point to another) in the piece?</li><li>(How) does the composer develop motivic ideas in the piece?</li><li>(How) does the composer create contrast?</li></ul><p>If you like or do not like a work, you should still be able to address these issues. You don’t have to like everything you listen to, and you <em>should</em> listen to things that you don’t like. A thoughtful and mature musician like you should be able to listen to any piece of music and identify at least one thing that you would want to emulate in your own music <em>and</em> at least one thing you would want to write differently.</p><p>Lastly, this is not a review of the performance. You may comment on the performance, but our primary focus is the compositions.</p><p>This assignment will be open throughout the semester and due during the last week of classes. Please start as soon as possible. I would <em>strongly</em> encourage you to write your response as soon after the performance as you can, while it is still fresh in your mind.</p><h2 id="rubric"><a href="#rubric" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Rubric</h2><ul><li>10 points: The written response met the minimum requirements for thoroughness. It made specific and thoughtful observations about the pieces in the performance. The writing was clear and easy to understand.</li><li>6-9 points: The written response met the minimum length requirements. Some passages were vague, unclear, or irrelevant to the pieces or performers.</li><li>0-5 points: The written response did not meet the minimum requirements. It made few significant observations about the pieces in the performance. Some parts may have been difficult to understand.</li></ul></div><div class="page-edit"><!----><!----></div><!----></div></div></div>

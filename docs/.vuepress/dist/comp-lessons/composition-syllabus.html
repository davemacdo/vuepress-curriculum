Students will present performances of some of these works. They will also develop a greater understanding of musical repertoire of the 20th and 21st centuries through guided listening, score study, masterclasses, and concert attendance.</p><h2 id="objectives"><a href="#objectives" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Objectives</h2><ul><li>develop compositional skills and fluency with a variety of media, including chamber, choral/vocal, large ensemble music, and others according to student interest</li><li>develop technical facility in writing for various instruments and voices</li><li>create works with a variety of forms and durations</li><li>build a well-balanced portfolio of works</li><li>produce and present professional-quality printed scores and parts</li><li>practice skills associated with arranging and presenting performances of one’s music, including speaking and writing about it</li></ul><h2 id="course-materials"><a href="#course-materials" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Course Materials</h2><p>There is no required textbook, but a copy of a good orchestration book will come in handy. I recommend Samuel Adler’s <em>The Study of Orchestration</em> or Kent Kennan’s <em>The Technique of Orchestration</em>. (UCF Orchestration courses use the Adler.)</p><p>I also recommend that students consider purchasing a copy of Elaine Gould’s <em>Behind Bars</em>. This is an incredible resource on the best practices of music notation. You’d be surprised at how often our notation software gets things wrong! Gould’s book will serve you for as long as you are preparing scores as a composer, arranger, or teacher.</p><p>Students will work on scores in a variety of formats, depending on the project. However, all students should be prepared to work in both paper-and-pencil and digital notation. Each student may choose whatever professional scoring application they are most comfortable with for final versions of scores.</p><p>Additional score study, listening, and reading may be assigned on a case-by-case basis. Students should plan to have access to Spotify (a free account is fine) and the UCF library resources. Students may wish to upgrade to a Spotify premium account to remove ads, get higher-quality audio, and be more independent on the mobile app. The steep <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/student/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">student discount<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> makes this a very good value for the price.</p><h3 id="recommended-periodicals"><a href="#recommended-periodicals" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Recommended Periodicals</h3><p>In the interest of staying current with news in the field of new music, composers are encouraged to read about new works, recordings, and essays.

If anyone believes the design of this course poses barriers to effectively participating and/or demonstrating learning in this course, please meet with me (with or without a Student Accessibility Services (SAS) accommodation letter) to discuss reasonable options or adjustments. During our discussion, I may suggest the possibility/necessity of your contacting SAS (Ferrell Commons 185; 407-823-2371; <a href="mailto:sas@ucf.edu">sas@ucf.edu</a>) to talk about academic accommodations. You are welcome to talk to me at any point in the semester about course design concerns, but it is always best if we can talk at least one week prior to the need for any modifications.</p><h2 id="ucf-creed"><a href="#ucf-creed" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> UCF Creed</h2><p>UCF faculty support the UCF Creed. Integrity - practicing and defending academic and personal honesty - is the first tenet of the UCF Creed. This is in part a reflection of the second tenet, Scholarship: - I will cherish and honor learning as a fundamental purpose of membership in the UCF community. - Course assignments and tests are designed to have educational value; the process of preparing for and completing these exercises will help improve your skills and knowledge. Material presented to satisfy course requirements is therefore expected to be the result of your own original scholarly efforts.</p><p>Plagiarism and cheating - presenting another’s ideas, arguments, words or images as your own, using unauthorized material, or giving or accepting unauthorized help on assignments or tests - contradict the educational value of these exercises. Students who attempt to obtain unearned academic credentials that do not reflect their skills and knowledge can also undermine the value of the UCF degrees earned by their more honest peers.</p><h2 id="diversity-and-inclusion"><a href="#diversity-and-inclusion" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Diversity and Inclusion</h2><p>The University of Central Florida considers the diversity of its students, faculty, and staff to be a strength and critical to its educational mission. UCF expects every member of the university community to contribute to an inclusive and respectful culture for all in its classrooms, work environments, and at campus events. Dimensions of diversity can include sex, race, age, national origin, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, intellectual and physical ability, sexual orientation, income, faith and non-faith perspectives, socio-economic class, political ideology, education, primary language, family status, military experience, cognitive style, and communication style. The individual intersection of these experiences and characteristics must be valued in our community.</p><p>Title IX prohibits sex discrimination, including sexual misconduct, sexual violence, sexual harassment, and retaliation.

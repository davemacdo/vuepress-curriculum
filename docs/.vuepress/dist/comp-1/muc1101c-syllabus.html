You'd be surprised at how often our notation software gets things wrong!

The attendance grade will be proportional to the number of class meetings and reading sessions the student attends, allowing <strong><em>two</em></strong> unexcused absences only. Students will not be excused from lessons. Because members of the class will rely on one another, reading sessions will only be excused for university sanctioned travel or documented medical or family emergency, and only if the instructor is notified as soon as possible of the conflict.</li><li><strong>Études, exercises, discussions, and lessons</strong>: Small composition assignments, written/in-class discussions, and other exercises will be assigned at various points in the term. Each student will meet for an individual lesson with the instructor one to two times in preparation for each composition assignment. Some particularly large assignments may be double the usual weight. These will be clearly indicated in the assignment specification or rubric.</li><li><strong>Listening Exam</strong>: Various listening activities will be assigned throughout the semester. Some will have discussion boards attached, others will be presented in class. All of these may be included on a listening identification exam at the end of the semester.</li><li><strong>Concerts</strong>: Students must attend at least two concerts featuring new music and write a brief summary of their experience.</li></ul><h2 id="communication"><a href="#communication" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Communication</h2><p>Please be sure to check Webcourses notifications as well as your UCF email address on a regular basis for information and announcements about the course.</p><h2 id="important-message-for-students-receiving-financial-aid-please-read"><a href="#important-message-for-students-receiving-financial-aid-please-read" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Important Message for students receiving financial aid! Please read!</h2><p>All faculty members are required to document students' academic activity at the beginning of each course. In order to document that you began this course, please complete the discussion assignment on Webcourses by the end of the day (11:59pm) on Friday of week 1. Failure to do so will result in a delay in the disbursement of your financial aid.</p><h2 id="course-accessibility-statement"><a href="#course-accessibility-statement" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Course Accessibility Statement</h2><p>It is my goal that this class be an accessible and welcoming experience for all students, including those with disabilities that may impact learning in this class. If anyone believes the design of this course poses barriers to effectively participating and/or demonstrating learning in this course, please meet with me (with or without a Student Accessibility Services (SAS) accommodation letter) to discuss reasonable options or adjustments. During our discussion, I may suggest the possibility/necessity of your contacting SAS (Ferrell Commons 185; 407-823-2371; sas@ucf.edu) to talk about academic accommodations. You are welcome to talk to me at any point in the semester about course design concerns, but it is always best if we can talk at least one week prior to the need for any modifications.</p><h2 id="ucf-creed"><a href="#ucf-creed" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> UCF Creed</h2><p>UCF faculty support the UCF Creed. Integrity - practicing and defending academic and personal honesty - is the first tenet of the UCF Creed. This is in part a reflection of the second tenet, Scholarship: - I will cherish and honor learning as a fundamental purpose of membership in the UCF community. - Course assignments and tests are designed to have educational value; the process of preparing for and completing these exercises will help improve your skills and knowledge. Material presented to satisfy course requirements is therefore expected to be the result of your own original scholarly efforts.</p><p>Plagiarism and cheating - presenting another’s ideas, arguments, words or images as your own, using unauthorized material, or giving or accepting unauthorized help on assignments or tests - contradict the educational value of these exercises. Students who attempt to obtain unearned academic credentials that do not reflect their skills and knowledge can also undermine the value of the UCF degrees earned by their more honest peers.</p><h2 id="diversity-and-inclusion"><a href="#diversity-and-inclusion" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Diversity and Inclusion</h2><p>The University of Central Florida considers the diversity of its students, faculty, and staff to be a strength and critical to its educational mission. UCF expects every member of the university community to contribute to an inclusive and respectful culture for all in its classrooms, work environments, and at campus events. Dimensions of diversity can include sex, race, age, national origin, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, intellectual and physical ability, sexual orientation, income, faith and non-faith perspectives, socio-economic class, political ideology, education, primary language, family status, military experience, cognitive style, and communication style. The individual intersection of these experiences and characteristics must be valued in our community.</p><p>Title IX prohibits sex discrimination, including sexual misconduct, sexual violence, sexual harassment, and retaliation. If you or someone you know has been harassed or assaulted, you can find resources available to support the victim, including confidential resources and information concerning reporting options at www.shield.ucf.edu and <a href="http://cares.sdes.ucf.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://cares.sdes.ucf.edu/<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>.</p><p>If there are aspects of the design, instruction, and/or experiences within this course that result in barriers to your inclusion or accurate assessment of achievement, please notify the instructor as soon as possible and/or contact Student Accessibility Services.</p><h2 id="grade-scale"><a href="#grade-scale" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Grade Scale</h2><table><thead><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align:center">Grade Scale</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:center">A</td><td>93 - 100</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">A-</td><td>90 - 92</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">B+</td><td>87 - 89</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">B</td><td>83 - 86</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">B-</td><td>80 - 82</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">C+</td><td>77 - 79</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">C</td><td>73 - 76</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">C-</td><td>70 - 72</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">D</td><td>60 - 69</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">F</td><td>0 - 59</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>This syllabus is subject to change.

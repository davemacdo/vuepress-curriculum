# Secondary Music Composition Syllabus

### Independent Study

Instructor: Dr. David MacDonald
Email: David.MacDonald@ucf.edu
Office: PAC M230

#### Description

Students interested in intermediate composition study who are not composition majors will create a variety of musical works according to their own interest and the guidance of the professor. Students may present performances of some of these works. They will also develop a greater understanding of musical repertoire of the 20th and 21st centuries through guided listening, score study, masterclasses, and concert attendance.

#### Objectives

* develop compositional skills and fluency with a variety of media, including chamber, choral/vocal, large ensemble music, and others according to student interest
* develop technical facility in writing for various instruments and voices
* create works with a variety of forms and durations
* build a well-balanced portfolio of works
* produce and present professional-quality printed scores and parts

#### Course Prerequisites

* MUT 2126 - Music Theory and Musicianship III
* MUT 2127 - Music Theory and Musicianship IV
* MUC 1101C - Composition I
* MUC 2104C - Composition II

Students must have completed the four-semester musicianship sequence, as well as both introductory composition classes.

#### Course Materials

There is no required textbook, but a copy of a good orchestration book will come in handy. I recommend Samuel Adler’s *The Study of Orchestration* or Kent Kennan’s *The Technique of Orchestration*. (UCF Orchestration courses use the Adler.)

I also recommend that students consider purchasing a copy of Elaine Gould's _Behind Bars_. This is an incredible resource on the best practices of music notation. You'd be surprised at how often our notation software gets things wrong! Gould's book will serve you for as long as you are preparing scores as a composer, arranger, or teacher. 

Students will work on scores in a variety of formats, depending on the project. However, all students should be prepared to work in both paper-and-pencil and digital notation. Each student may choose whatever professional scoring application they are most comfortable with for final versions of scores.

Additional score study, listening, and reading may be assigned on a case-by-case basis. Students should plan to have access to Spotify (a free account is fine) and the UCF library resources. Students may wish to upgrade to a Spotify premium account to remove ads, get higher-quality audio, and be more independent on the mobile app. The steep [student discount](https://www.spotify.com/us/student/) makes this a very good value for the price.  

#### Grading

The semester grade will be weighted based on the following point scales.

| Grades ||
| :---: | --- |
| 5 pts.,<br>composition goals | At the beginning of the semester, each composer will create a set of compositional goals for the music they will write. These may include long-term goals, but must include plans for the current semester and academic year. These goals will be set in consultation with the instructor and may be changed throughout the semester based on the composer's interests, level of development, and the nature of the specific projects. This must be completed during the first week of the semester! |
| 60 pts.,<br>weekly lesson preparation | Students will be evaluated on significant progress made toward composition goals. |
| 10 pts.,<br>weekly listening discussion | Students will participate in a weekly discussion board on a different piece of music. |
| 5 pts.,<br>recital attendance | Composers are expected to attend all Composition Forums, Area Recitals, and Collide concerts. Other events may be required at the instructor's discretion. |
| 5 pts.,<br>masterclass attendance | All composers are expected to attend the weekly composition masterclass. |

See assignment rubrics for further detail. Composers enrolled in secondary lessons (unlike those enrolled in Comp III-VI) are encouraged to present a performance of their work on campus; but, this is not required. 

#### Lesson Attendance

Each student will have a one-hour lesson for each week of the term. Lessons may need to be rescheduled for university holidays, schedule conflicts, illness, etc. Lessons must be made up within two weeks of the original date.

Students must arrive at lessons on time. Students arriving late will be penalized two points lesson points after five minutes and four lesson points after ten minutes. Students arriving more than fifteen minutes after their scheduled lesson time will receive a zero for the lesson. Unexcused absences will result in a 0 for the lesson, and these lessons *will not be made up*. When running late or are otherwise unavailable, it is the student's responsibility to to inform the professor as early as possible.

#### Performance Attendance

Composers are expected to attend all Composition Forums, Area Recitals, and Collide concerts. Other events may be required at the instructor's discretion. Composers will only be excused for documented emergencies or pre-cleared academic conflicts. Work obligations are not an acceptable excuse. Excused absences from performances will be made up in coordination with the instructor.

#### Important Message for students receiving financial aid! Please read!

All faculty members are required to document students' academic activity at the beginning of each course. In order to document that you began this course, please complete the assignment “Composition Goals, First Draft” on Webcourses by the end of the day (11:59pm) on Friday of week 1. Failure to do so will result in a delay in the disbursement of your financial aid.

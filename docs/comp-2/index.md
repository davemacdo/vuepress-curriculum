title: Welcome to Composition 2
---

The course builds on skills and techniques of music composition first introduced in Composition 1, exploring some of the most fundamental concepts in composing original and creative concert music. Students will listen to contemporary concert music, practice writing short études, and present three short, original compositions over the course of the semester. An additional focus of the course is to prepare students to apply to upper-division composition studies.

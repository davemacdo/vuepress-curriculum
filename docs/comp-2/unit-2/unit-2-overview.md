title: "Unit 2: Mixing Traditions"
---

This unit we will focus music which connects the concert music tradition to popular and folk music.

Readings are provided in the **Files** section of Webcourses or linked on external sites. I’ve compiled the unit’s listening into a single Spotify playlist where possible. You may also use other recordings if you wish.

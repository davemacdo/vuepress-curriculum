title: "Discussion: Mixing Traditions"
---

At a very high level, scholars often group musical practice into three broad traditions based on the goals and circumstances of the practitioners:

- folk: primary goal of entertaining oneself and one's immediate friends and family; created by amateurs in a social gathering for little or no compensation; usually an oral tradition
- popular: created by professionals primarily to be sold as a commodity; usually an oral tradition
- art: created by professionals for the primary goal of artistic expression (whatever that means) regardless of economic value

Many years ago, I read a review of a concert that offered the axiom "the intersection of classical and popular music is almost always _con queso_." This is, sadly, the earned reputation of many pieces of classical music that reflect on other styles.

Write a discussion post that addresses the blending of musical traditions. Address the concerns in the questions below; but, write in paragraphs rather than question-answer pairs. 

- What does it mean for popular or folk music to be "authentic"? How is this different from authenticity in art music?
- How can classical music reflect or embrace popular and folk music in a way that is neither a pale imitation nor an exploitative coopting of the music of another group?
- What kinds of folk or popular styles interest you, and what specific musical devices (describe in technical, theory-class terms) interest you about that music?

In preparing your essay, you may wish to review excerpts from Gunther Schuller's writing on what he calls "the third stream" from the Files section on Webcourses. Your post should be a _minimum of 500 words_ but may be longer if you wish. Make your initial post _at least one full day before the discussion board deadline!_ Afterwards, respond to at least one other post on the discussion board. Your response should be substantive and offer specific suggestions or ask specific questions.

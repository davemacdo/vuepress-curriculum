title: Non-classical Research and Listening
---

Gunther Schuller (1925 - 2015) created the term "the Third Stream" in a 1957 lecture to describe music that was neither jazz nor classical music. As a performer, Schuller had played horn in the New York Metropolitan Opera orchestra _and_ with Miles Davis's "Birth of the Cool" nonet! The Third Stream was his way of thinking about a new kind of music that was neither jazz nor classical, but combined elements of each.

## Research

Find a particular recording of non-classical music that is meaningful or interesting to you, it could be anything from jazz, to hip hop, to West African drumming. The recording should be accessible somehow online so that you can send a link to me and share it in class. This will serve as a model for the non-classical elements of an étude you will write in a subsequent assignment. Listen to the recording several times. Identify what you find interesting about it. Consider how the music is similar to Western classical music and how it is different in specific, technical ways.

## Listening and planning

Consider a piece that you might write for piano alone or with another instrument. Identify at least _one or two musical elements_ of the model that are not usually a part of the Western classical tradition (including contemporary music) that you will use in your piece. That could be a rhythm, a meter, a texture, a scale, a harmony, an instrumental technique, etc. Then, identify at least two musical elements that are not part of your model's tradition that you will use in the piece. 

## Deliverables

- **PDF:** A document file that includes the following: 
	- a link to your model (YouTube, SoundCloud, etc.)
	- a sentence or two describing what you find interesting about it and/or why you selected it
	- list of elements from your model that you will use (one or more)
	- list of elements from the classical tradition that you will use (two or more)
- **Class presentation:** We may not get to everyone, but be prepared to play part of your model recording in class and talk about the musical elements you identified.

## Rubric

### Link and description (2 points)

- 2: The link works and description is clear.
- 0: The link or description are unclear. 

### Listening and planning (3 points)

- 3: Elements identified from the model are clear and separate from Western tradition. Elements from outside the model are clear. 
- 2: Elements are identified, but may not be clear, or may not be distinct to either the model or the Western tradition. 
- 0: Elements are poorly identified or difficult to understand.

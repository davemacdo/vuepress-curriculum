## Melodic motives

Create **four** melodic motives of three to five pitches. Write them in either treble or bass clef in whole notes. Do not use a key signature or imply a key. A final expression of the motive in a piece of music might have a key, but save that for later.

Remember that the motive needs to be simple, yet distinctive. A scale or arpeggio by itself is unlikely to be memorable. Listen to Shostakovich's monogram motive in his String Quartet No. 8 as an example.

## Deliverable

- **PDF (preferred) or paper**:
	- Your four motives, in whole notes.
	- If writing on paper, leave a blank system between lines.
	- If you write on paper, you can scan your work on a smartphone and submit a PDF.

Come to class prepared to dissect and analyze your motives. Think about what makes each one distinctive and how you could transform it.

title: Motive Practice 2
---

## Making the "Menu"

Select one motive that comprises three to five pitches (no more) in a particular order. These may be expressed with any rhythm and may be from a previous assignment or activity in the class.

On staff paper (_not on the computer_), write _at least twenty_ distinct transformations of your motive. You may use any technique you want to transform your motive, but each version should be distinct. Use the widest variety of transformations you can think of. Avoid outlining triads and diatonic scales. Number your transformations.

## Deliverables

Digital submission only. Scan handwritten documents. Always leave a blank staff between systems when writing by hand.

	- your motive in its original form, labeled
	- your transformations, numbered

## Thinking ahead

Consider how these motive transformations could be used in combinations with one another to create phrases and phrase groups. Think about the ways in which they are similar and the ways in which they are different. How could you use their differences to organize a piece of music into sections using only transformations of this single motive?

## Rubric

- 5: The work includes a single motive that meets the minimum requirements presented in the assignment. Twenty or more distinct transformations are written and clearly labeled.
- 4: The work includes a single motive that meets the minimum requirements. Twenty transformations are written, but some of them may be redundant.
- 2: The original motive was presented. Fewer than twenty transformations may have been presented, or many of the transformations were either redundant or relied strongly on triads or diatonic scales. The submission was unclear or difficult to understand.
- 0: No initial motive was presented that met the assignment guidelines. The submitted document was difficult to understand.

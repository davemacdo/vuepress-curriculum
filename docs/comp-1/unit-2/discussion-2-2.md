# Discussion: John Cage and _4\'33\"_

Read the excerpt from _No Such Thing As Silence_, a book by composer and former _Village Voice_ music critic Kyle Gann.

Cage's most celebrated and infamous work has had as much written about it as any work of its time or since. Regardless of what you think of the work or Cage as a whole, we can't go back and write music before 1952. The music you write today must live in the same universe as _4\'33\"_.

Write a post on this discussion board in response to the excerpt. Your post should be a _minimum_ of 500 words long, but may be longer if you wish. Consider addressing the following:

- what Cage wanted his audience to take away from _4\'33\"_
- what you can learn as a _listener_ from _4\'33\"_
- what you can learn as a _composer_ from _4\'33\"_
- how _4\'33\"_ is or is not reflected in your own work, or how audiences might hear your work in relation to _4\'33\"_

Once you've made your post, consider responding to a classmates post. Do so substantively in a way that contributes to the conversation. Just saying "Nice post!" is friendly but doesn't do much to enrich the discussion. Come to class prepared to discuss the contents of the reading and your post.

title: 'Composition Project: Motivic Development'
---

## Overview

Write a piece of music for unaccompanied single-line instrument or voice (_vocalise_, no text) that focuses on the concept of motivic economy and development. The piece should be 1-3 minutes long[^length] and should contain no more than two primary motives.

Your piece should not use meter or barlines, though you should write rhythms. Do not outline a triad or use more than four consecutive steps of a diatonic scale. These guidelines are not to limit you, but rather to push you to try new and possibly uncomfortable sounds.

All compositions will be read in our class reading sessions. Please confirm with those reading your music at least one week prior to the readings.

## Assignment deliverables and readings

Each of these is required. Submit all digital files via Webcourses. Bring paper copies to class for reading sessions.

* **PDF**:
    * full score, either hand-written or computer-engraved
* **PDF**:
    * Reflection: A brief written description of the motives you used and how you used them (100-200 words).
* **Paper submission**:
    * hard copy of the score and parts for reading. *Performance materials should be clean, clear, and professional. If you aren't sure what your score or parts should look like, compare them to scores and parts from a major publisher.*

## Grading

Please review the Composition Project Rubric in the Pages tab of Webcourses.

[^length]: Pieces with slower tempos and rhythms should be at the longer end of this range. Pieces with faster tempos and rhythms may be closer to one minute.

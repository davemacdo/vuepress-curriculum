- Newness in new music
    - originality, creativity, expression
    - "Parable of the Really Good Bar Band"
- Copland discussion
    - Planes
        - **sensuous plane**
            - "warm shower listening"
            - Copland: "brainless but attractive state"
        - **expressive plane**
            - Copland admits this is controversial!
            - Copland does not mean _espressivo_, as in "they play with great expression and passion."
            - extra-musical expression (something outside of music)
            - tell of my argument with trombone prof. about the "meaning" of a Torelli trumpet concerto
            - Be sure you are considering what something meant to the composer as well as your own experience. _Film music warning!_
        - **sheerly musical plane**
            - Copland: "music does exist in terms of the notes themselves and of their manipulation"
            - this is the _actual_ music (NB: the score is not the music!)
            - requires attention and thoughtfulness
            - does it require training? practice?
- Debussy: _Syrinx_ (1913)
    - what key are we in?
    - focal tone
    - cadences?
    - note that there are some hints of functional harmony, but a lot of fuzziness as well
    - sometimes harmony is not used for function at all here, but for sound
    - we spend much (most?) of the piece hanging around Bb minor, but end on Db.
    - WTF last system??? (odd whole tone scale)
- Debussy: Prelude No. 4 from Book I (1910-11)

title: Tonality étude
---

This assignment builds on your previous assignment. You will take the melodic forms your created and assemble them into a short piece of music. 

## Étude

Compose a brief, unaccompanied solo étude[^solo] for _your own instrument_, 25–35 measures long, that uses some (not all) of the forms of your melody. If you find it necessary or helpful, you may add some interstitial material around the statements of your melody, such as an introduction, transitions, or a coda. Your étude should express a clear tonal center (which can move) _without_ using common-practice, functional harmony. Please come to class prepared to _perform_ your piece and present it for feedback. Write your étude on paper by hand, _not_ using a computer. 

## Suggestions

- Be careful with cadences. Try to make sure the piece continues to move forward, even at local resting points. 
- While the previous assignment on scale structures was somewhat abstract, this is time we're creating a very tiny piece of music. Include dynamics, articulation, and other information, aside from just the notes and rhythms.
- You may not be in the habit of writing music by hand, so here are a few pro tips:
    - Start the music on the second or third staff. This gives you space to write your name, a title, or other things above the first system.
    - Leave one blank staff between systems. That helps avoid crowded dynamics. 
    - Take a quick look at a published score and make sure you're not forgetting anything critical. It's easy to forget the things that Sibelius and Finale do for you automatically. 

## Deliverables

- **PDF:**
    - Your complete étude score.

Bring your instrument to class to present your work! These don't need to be fully realized performances; we're just reading for one another. No pressure.

## Rubric

### Étude

- 4: The étude presents two or more versions of the melody and establishes a tonal center while avoiding functional harmony.
- 3: The étude presents two or more versions of the melody, but does not establish a tonal center or relies too heavily on functional harmony.

### Score

- 1: The score is clear and readable. It includes all the information needed to realize the music, including dynamics and articulations. 
- 0: The score may be missing some information, or may be somewhat difficult to read.

[^solo]: In order to focus on melody, pianists and guitarists should focus on a solo line. Treat your instrument as a violin or cello, similar to a one-hand piano work. Vocalists should plan to sing their work as a vocalise (without text).

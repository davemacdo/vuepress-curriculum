Readings are provided in the **Files** section of Webcourses or linked on external sites. I've compiled the unit's listening into a single Spotify playlist where possible. You may also use other recordings if you wish. Scores are linked or available on Webcourses where possible.

## Don't forget

You can choose any two composition concerts to write about for your performance attendance assignments. These can be completed at any time throughout the semester; but, you'll be happier if you get them done sooner. More importantly, the sooner you write the reflection after the concert, the easier it will be.

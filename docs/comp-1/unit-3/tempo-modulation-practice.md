Title: Tempo Modulation

## Instructions

Compose two short studies, six to eight measures long, for body/found percussion, one or two players. You may include clapping, stomping, vocalizations, etc. In each study, include a tempo modulation. Be sure to clearly establish the original tempo, then use a metric modulation that relates to a rhythm that is in the composition. 

In the first study, choose a modulation that speeds up the tempo; in the second, choose one that slows down. Use a different ratio for each modulation, and give the metronome markings for before and after the modulation.

Review Elliott Carter's _Canaries_ for examples of simple metric modulations.

## Deliverables

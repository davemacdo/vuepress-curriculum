  title: Tempo Modulation
---

Compose two short studies, six to eight measures long, for body/found percussion, one or two players. You may include clapping, stomping, vocalizations, etc. In each study, include a tempo modulation. Be sure to clearly establish the original tempo, then use a metric modulation that relates to a rhythm that is in the composition. 

In the first study, choose a modulation that speeds up the tempo; in the second, choose one that slows down. Use a different ratio for each modulation, and give the metronome markings for before and after the modulation.

Review Elliott Carter's _Canaries_ for examples of simple metric modulations.

## Deliverables

Digital submission only. Scan handwritten documents. Always leave a blank staff between systems when writing by hand.

- **PDF**: Your two tempo modulation studies, labeled and with clear tempo modulations.

## Rubric

- 5: The submission includes two studies. Both are clearly notated, include at least one metric modulation as specified in the instructions. Tempo markings are accurate.
- 4: The submission includes two studies. The metric modulation notation may be unclear, or the tempo markings may be inaccurate.
- 2: One or both of the studies does not meet the minimum requirements. The two modulations may be the same ratio, or overly simple (such as 2:1). The notation may be unclear or difficult to understand.
- 0: The submitted scores are unclear or do not include clear metric modulations.

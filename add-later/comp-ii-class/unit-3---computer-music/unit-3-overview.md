Title: Unit 3 - Introduction to Computer Music

This unit we will explore using Pure Data as a platform for creating music. This may require a fair amount of experimentation, trial, and error. There are some resources linked below which you may find helpful.

Readings are provided in the **Files** section of Webcourses or linked on external sites. I’ve compiled the unit’s listening into a single Spotify playlist where possible. You may also use other recordings if you wish.

- Readings: Monday, 30 April, 10:00a - 12:50pm, **T204**

## Resources

- [puredata.info](http://puredata.info) - This is about as close to an official website as there is for Pd. (The real [official site](http://msp.ucsd.edu/) is not very useful for much beyond downloading the tool.)
- [Pd forums](https://forum.pdpatchrepo.info/) - There are nice people here. Be nice and ask specific questions if you are looking for help. Or, you can just search their very useful archives.
- [Pure Data Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL12DC9A161D8DC5DC) by Rafael Hernandez - Hernandez offers some succinct introductory videos that are a good place to start. When he refers to "Pure Data extended", note that it no longer is supported. The modern equivalent is Pd-l2Ork, or [Purr Data](https://github.com/jonwwilkes/purr-data/releases). If you're using Pd on the iMacs in the lab, they're running "vanilla" Pd. Everything he demonstrates here will work fine in both places. Also, you don't necessarily need to watch them in sequence. Once you get through the basics, feel free to jump around if you see a topic that interests you.

## Further Listening

These will not be directly discussed in class; but, you should study these recordings while working on the unit project (during lesson weeks). They may appear on the final listening exam as well. You are responsible for knowing them, along with the in-class listening (above).

- Pauline Oliveros: _Bye Bye Butterfly_ (1965)
- Iannis Xenakis: _La Légende d'Eer_ (1977), Pt. 1
- Iannis Xenakis: _Mycenae Alpha_ (1978)
- Stockhausen: _Solo, Work No. 19_ (1966)

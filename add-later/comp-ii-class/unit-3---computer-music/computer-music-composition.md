There may be more than one computer part, and Pd patches may be controlled manually by a performer, react programmatically, or both. The instrumentation may anything that can be read during our class reading sessions. The piece should be 1-3 minutes long[^length] and should _reflect something new about the topics we have discussed in class, or discovered in assigned listening._ All compositions will be read in our class reading sessions, so please consider the available performers in our class and technical limitations of sight-readers.

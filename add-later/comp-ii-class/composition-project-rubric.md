# Composition I-II: Project Rubric

You will see that some parts of this rubric are quite rigid while others are more subjective. It is important that you are able to express your musical ideas freely while also staying in the context of our class assignments. If you feel that your work has been evaluated unfairly, please discuss it with the professor.

## Preparation and Professionalism

### Score and part preparation: *10 points*

* **10 points:** The score was professionally prepared and performance ready. The materials were presented to the performers professionally.
* **6-9 points:** The score was unclear in places, but the main ideas were still expressed. The performance materials may have contained errors or inconsistencies.

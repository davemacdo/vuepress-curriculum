## Further Listening

These will not be directly discussed in class; but, you should study these recordings while working on the unit project (during lesson weeks). They may appear on the final listening exam as well. You are responsible for knowing them, along with the in-class listening (above).

- John Cage: _Sonatas and Interludes_ (1946 - 1948)
- George Crumb: _Vox Balaenae_ (1971)

## Don't forget

You can choose any two composition concerts to write about for your performance attendance assignments. These can be completed at any time throughout the semester; but, you'll be happier if you get them done sooner. More importantly, the sooner you write the reflection after the concert, the easier it will be.

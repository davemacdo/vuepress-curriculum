# Notation Experiment

I love science. Don't you? Let's do an experiment.

Come up with a relatively simple musical idea that you think might be difficult to conveny in conventional notation. Express that idea in a piece that is around 30 seconds long, though it could be longer if you want. The instrumentation should be suitable for a class reading session; but do not include yourself! _Be sure to let your classmates know if you are relying on them for the reading so they can be sure to bring their instruments._

## Graphic Notation

Express your musical idea in a graphic score. Focus on the core elements of your idea. Perhaps the contour is more important than the specific pitches, or the gesture and texture are more important than specific meters. Give as much explanation as you need, but be sure to leave some room for the performer to make decisions about parameters you don't feel as strongly about. Be as _unspecific_ as possible while still expressing your primary goals.

## Deliverables

**Paper** (for a change!): Your score (and if applicable, parts), on paper, for a class reading session.

## Graphic Notation (5 points)

- 5: The work was clearly expressed in graphic notation. Some parameters were clearly defined, while others were left to the performer. The performance instructions made the interpretation of graphical elements clear.
- 4: Graphic notation was presented in a novel way. Performance instructions were clear about some musical parameters, but not about others.
- 2: The graphic notation was vague or only vaguely explained in the performance instructions. It was unclear how the graphic score should be interpreted by players.

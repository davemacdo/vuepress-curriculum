# Secondary Music Composition Syllabus

### Independent Study

Instructor: Dr. David MacDonald
Email: David.MacDonald@ucf.edu
Office: PAC M230

#### Description

Students interested in intermediate composition study who are not composition majors will create a variety of musical works according to their own interest and the guidance of the professor. Students may present performances of some of these works. They will also develop a greater understanding of musical repertoire of the 20th and 21st centuries through guided listening, score study, masterclasses, and concert attendance.

#### Objectives

* develop compositional skills and fluency with a variety of media according to student interest
* develop technical facility in writing for various instruments and voices
* create works with a variety of forms and durations
* produce and present professional-quality printed scores and parts

#### Course Materials

There is no required textbook, but a copy of a good orchestration book will come in handy. I recommend Samuel Adler’s *The Study of Orchestration* or Kent Kennan’s *The Technique of Orchestration*. (UCF Orchestration courses use the Adler.)

I also recommend that students consider purchasing a copy of Elaine Gould's _Behind Bars_. This is an incredible resource on the best practices of music notation. You'd be surprised at how often our notation software gets things wrong! Gould's book will serve you for as long as you are preparing scores as a composer, arranger, or teacher. 

Students will work on scores in a variety of formats, depending on the project. However, all students should be prepared to work in both paper-and-pencil and digital notation. Each student may choose whatever _professional_ scoring application they are most comfortable with for final versions of scores. Work for lessons should be submitted as PDF and audio files (not score project files) via a shared Dropbox folder. 

Additional score study, listening, and reading may be assigned on a case-by-case basis. Students should plan to have access to Spotify (a free account is fine) and the UCF library resources. Students may wish to upgrade to a Spotify premium account to remove ads, get higher-quality audio, and be more independent on the mobile app. The steep [student discount](https://www.spotify.com/us/student/) makes this a very good value for the price.  

#### Grading

| Grades ||
| :---: | --- |
| 5%<br>composition goals | At the beginning of the semester, each composer will create a set of compositional goals for the music they will write. These may include long-term goals, but must include plans for the current semester and academic year. These goals will be set in consultation with the instructor and may be changed throughout the semester based on the composer's interests, level of development, and the nature of the specific projects. This must be completed during the first week of the semester! |
| 75%<br>weekly lesson preparation | Students will be evaluated on significant progress made toward composition goals. |
| 5%<br>recital attendance | Composers are expected to attend all Composition Forum, Collide Concerts, and composition degree recitals. Other events may be required at the instructor's discretion. |
| 15%<br>final assessment | On the last day of classes, the composer will submit scores to all works completed during the course of the semester for an overall evaluation. This must include at least one complete work, and may include more based on the goals set at the beginning of the semester. |

See assignment rubrics for further detail. Composers enrolled in secondary lessons and independent study (unlike those enrolled in Comp III-VI) are encouraged to present a performance of their work on campus; but, this is not required. Composition studio class meets on Mondays at 11:30-12:20 in T204 (SPA computer lab). Attendance is optional for those enrolled in independent study. All composers are strongly encouraged to attend sessions with guest artists. 

#### Communication

The composition studio uses two forms of communication: email and Slack. Composers will be added to a UCF Composition Google Group for emails and announcements. Slack is a group chat service that you can use on your phone or computer. [You can sign up for _our_ Slack group here](https://join.slack.com/t/ucfcomposition/signup). Please install the app on your phone so that we can communicate quickly when needed. 

#### Lesson Attendance

Each student will have a half-hour lesson for each week of the term. Lessons may need to be rescheduled for university holidays, schedule conflicts, illness, etc. Lessons must be made up within two weeks of the original date.

Students must arrive at lessons on time. Students arriving late will be penalized two points lesson points after five minutes and four lesson points after ten minutes. Students arriving more than fifteen minutes after their scheduled lesson time will receive a zero for the lesson. Unexcused absences will result in a 0 for the lesson, and these lessons *will not be made up*. When running late or are otherwise unavailable, it is the student's responsibility to to inform the professor as early as possible.

#### Important Message for students receiving financial aid! Please read!

All faculty members are required to document students' academic activity at the beginning of each course. In order to document that you began this course, please complete the assignment “Composition Goals, First Draft” on Webcourses by the end of the day (11:59pm) on Friday of week 1. Failure to do so will result in a delay in the disbursement of your financial aid.

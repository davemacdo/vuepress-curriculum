# Listening Assignment

## Introduction

Listening is important. Being able to hear a piece of music and understand its construction is not only critical to evaluating the music of others, but your own music as well. Furthermore, expressing a relevant musical thought in your music requires at least *some* understanding of the repertorial context. Listening critically and analytically is not easy, and it requires practice. Do not listen while doing other things. Sit down and focus as you would while reading a book or watching a movie. This will be difficult at first, but I promise that it will get easier and more rewarding as you practice it.

## Listening Discussion

Each week, you will listen to a particular work (or group of works). See the schedule below. Listen to the work attentively several times. You may listen to any recording you like, but each prompt will provide a link to Spotify, SoundCloud, YouTube, or something similar. Occasionally, you will find an extra, optional listening suggestion for added context, or because I just like the piece.

For each discussion, *you must make at least two posts*.

### Initial Post

_Make your first post to the discussion by the end of the day on Thursday._ This allows the rest of the class to read and reflect on what you've written for response posts. Your first post should be a minimum of 300 words. Express your thoughts on the piece. Focus on objective statements about how the work is constructed. Consider addressing the following (not all will apply to every piece):

* What about the piece do you find interesting?
* How does the composer make use of the instruments or voice types used?
* What textures does the composer use?
* (How) does the composer create a sense of progression (moving from one point to another) in the piece?
* (How) does the composer develop motivic ideas in the piece?
* (How) does the composer create contrast?

If you like or do not like a work, you should still be able to address these issues. You don't have to like everything you listen to, and you *should* listen to things that you don't like. A thoughtful and mature musician like you should be able to listen to any piece of music and identify at least one thing that you would want to emulate in your own music *and* at least one thing you would want to write differently.

### Response post

Respond to at least one person in the discussion. Be thoughtful; consider their observations. Feel free to question the conclusions of other composers, but *be nice*!

Posts are due on Sunday evenings.

# UCF Composition Jury

## Jury date: <br>Wednesday, 6 December 2017

All composition majors currently enrolled in private lessons are required to present their works written or substantially revised during the term to a faculty panel at the end of each semester. Students do not need to give a jury the same semester as a degree recital.

## Submission requirements

Submit a finished copy of all compositions completed (or partially completed) during the semester. Submissions are due the last day of classes.

- For works with a written score, this will include _one printed and bound copy_ of the score, as well as a digital copy in PDF format.
- A recording should also be submitted digitally. For acoustic works, this should be a recording of a performance or reading session if possible. MIDI realizations are accepted only when recordings are not possible.
- A list of all completed works (from the current term and before) in reverse chronological order. Include the _year completed_, _instrumentation_, and _duration_. This should be submitted in PDF format as well. 

### [Upload PDFs and Recordings HERE](https://www.dropbox.com/request/sH4aMCRFPWHAqPoQ2orE)

Submit both physical and digital materials to Dr. MacDonald (<David.MacDonald@ucf.edu>). If Dr. MacDonald is not available, hard copies may be left in the mail room. Students are encouraged to submit early.

Juries will be scheduled in twenty-minute sessions. ([Sign up here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Qqi7YqRCJWydlGtYmH_TnUNaxZ7hIuraSdYJt2oRwbs/edit?usp=sharing) as soon as possible.) Students should be prepared to explain the construction on their works, answer questions about them, and defend their compositional decisions.

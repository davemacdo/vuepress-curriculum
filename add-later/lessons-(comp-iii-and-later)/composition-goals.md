# Composition Goals

Plan your compositional projects for the next semester or longer. Strive to create a well-rounded portfolio that achieves your artistic goals. We will discuss this in lessons and refine it throughout the semester and year. Your lesson grades will be determined primarily by your progress toward reaching your goals. When describing new pieces, be as specific as you can be. At minimum, identify the medium (instrumentation) and approximate duration.

Address each of the following questions:

1. Think about your current portfolio of compositions. What about it is particularly strong? What do you think deserves more attention?
2. What are some specific pieces of music would you like to have written this semester?
3. Identify at least three new things you would like to try in your music this semester. (For example, you might want to try imitative counterpoint, spacialization, and extensive use of tempo modulations.)
4. What piece(s) would you like to have performed this semester?
